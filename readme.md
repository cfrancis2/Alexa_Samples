These are two sample Alexa projects I coded trying to learn the Alexa SDK.

To run these, you'll have to create an account on Amazon's developer site, and either upload the code into a lambda function,
or copy paste the code into the text editor they have.
There are steps here in which are probably easier to follow than for me to type it out:

The greeter example is basically just a 'hello world' example.

The city guide project is a littler more complex.  I will take the attractions and places I created and output them when asked for
what to do in a particular city.
